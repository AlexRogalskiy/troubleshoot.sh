All collectors inherit some common, shared properties.

### `collectorName`

Optionally, a collector can specify the `collectorName` property. This controls the exact path where the collector will be stored in the support bundle. If this property is not included, a generated path name that's relevant to the collector type and properties will be used.

### `exclude`

For collectors that are optional, based on runtime available configuration, the conditional can be specified in the `exclude` property. This is useful for Replciated applications that have access to the `{{repl ...}}` and `repl{{ ...}}` templating utility. Setting this to `false` will prevent the collector from running.

### `redactors`

If a collector might include sensitive information, redactors can be added. These have the same format as [global redactors](../redactors/overview), but only apply to resources generated by the collector they are attached to.
