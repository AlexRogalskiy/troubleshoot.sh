`troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2` was introduced in preflight and support-bundle krew plugin version 0.9.39 and Kots version 1.19.0. Users writing preflight checks or support-bundles targetting those releases or later should make use of `v1beta2`. If you are wriging checks and bundles solefly for the standalone krew plugins, then you can reasonably expect people can easily upgrade to a newer version, so you can still target `v1beta2`. But if you are bundling up your preflight checks and support-bundles into a Kots application, and your users are using older versions, or you have a mix of users and older and newer versions, you need to take care to maintain backwards and forwards compatibility.

Kots 1.19.0+ supports both `troubleshoot.replicated.com/v1beta1` and `troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2`, so the easiest thing to do would be simply keep using `v1beta1` until you are sure your users have all upgraded.

But if you want to upgrade early, or make use of some new functionality only available in `v1beta2`, then you can include both the old definitions and the new definitions in your Kots application at the same time, and newer Kots users will make use of the newer definitions, and older Kots users will simply ignore the new definitions. Then remove theh old `v1beta1` definitions only once all of your users have upgraded to Kots 1.19.0 or later.

Note: In `troubleshoot.replicated.com/v1beta1`, Analyzers and Collectors were specified as separate `Kind`s, whereas in `troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2` they were combined into a single `Kind` of `SupportBundle`.
